Dataset to predict tomorrow's rainfall using weather data for Australia.

1) Date: the date of observation
2) Location: the common name of the location of the weather station
3) MinTemp: the minimum temperature in degrees Celsius
4) MaxTemp: the maximum temperature in degrees Celsius
5) Rainfall: the amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm
6) Evaporation: the so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am
7) Sunshine: the number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.
8) WindGustDir: the direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
9) WindGustSpeed: the speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight
10) WindDir9am: direction of the wind at 9am
11) WindDir3pm: direction of the wind at 3pm
12) WindSpeed9am: wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am
13) WindSpeed3pm: wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm
14) Humidity9am: humidity (percent) at 9am
15) Humidity3pm: humidity (percent) at 3pm
16) Pressure9am: atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am
17) Pressure3pm: atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm
18) Cloud9am: fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.
19) Cloud3pm: fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values
20) Temp9am: temperature (degrees C) at 9am
21) Temp3pm: temperature (degrees C) at 3pm
22) RainToday (boolean): 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0
23) RISK_MM: the amount of rain. A kind of measure of the "risk".
24) RainTomorrow: the target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?
